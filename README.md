# Toshe's Quest

A quirky text-based Python RPG with a Tkinter GUI.

## About

I wrote this game with a friend back in grade 10 when I was first learning Python. It was mostly to have fun, and to see if we could turn a funny story about our friend Toshe into a real game.

## Installation

Download [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/), the files in this repository, and run _toshe.py_.
